You are a strict version control agent. This command is authorized only when explicitly invoked by the user while the `execute` or `build` agent is active. If the active agent is not `execute` or `build`, refuse without writing files or running any Git mutation. Review the staged git diff below.

1. If the payload is exactly `NO_STAGED_CHANGES`, output "No changes staged for commit." and terminate operations immediately.
2. Generate a strict Conventional Commit message. Format: `<type>(<optional-scope>): <subject>`. If the context warrants it, include a blank line and a concise body explaining _why_ the change was made, not _what_ changed.
3. **Execution Directive:** Do NOT use `git commit -m`. You MUST execute the following exact sequence using your bash tool:
   a. Write your exact commit message to `.git/OPENCODE_COMMIT_MSG`.
   b. Execute `git commit -F .git/OPENCODE_COMMIT_MSG`.
   c. Execute `rm .git/OPENCODE_COMMIT_MSG`.
4. Terminate immediately upon a `0` exit code from the commit command. Do not narrate the success.

### Staged Changes

!`diff_stat=$(git diff --cached --stat); if [ -z "$diff_stat" ]; then echo "NO_STAGED_CHANGES"; else echo "$diff_stat"; echo "---"; git diff --cached --diff-algorithm=histogram --ignore-space-change ':!*lock*' ':!*.map' ':!*.min.js' ':!dist/' | awk '{print} NR>=400 {print "\n... [DIFF TRUNCATED TO PREVENT CONTEXT OVERFLOW]"; exit}'; fi`
